For this project, we used Jupyter, a Python notebook, to perform our analyses. A PostgreSQL data warehouse was used to store client retail data. Using Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib, we manipulate the dataset and display the results. By using RFM market research, we were able to segment customers so that the store could develop marketing campaigns targeting both old and new customers.",

At Jarvis, I developed skills in Java, Python, Git, SQL, Bash, Maven, and Docker while participating in various challenging projects using an Agile/Scrum framework. Throughout my professional career, I have enjoyed debugging and solving complex problems, and I aim to work in an environment that demands an innovative approach to problem-solving. After realizing how satisfying it is to solve technical problems, I decided to switch my career to data engineering. Over the next few years, I would go on to teach myself data structures, algorithms, and programming through various courses and projects."
