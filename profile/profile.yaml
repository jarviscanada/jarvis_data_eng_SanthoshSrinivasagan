summary: "Working as a robotics programmer and having an electrical engineering background has prepared me to have a mindset of being open to learning any number of tools or technologies to solve a problem. At Jarvis, I developed skills in Java, Python, Git, SQL, Bash, Maven, and Docker while participating in various challenging projects using an Agile/Scrum framework. Throughout my professional career, I have enjoyed debugging and solving complex problems, and I aim to work in an environment that demands an innovative approach to problem-solving. After realizing how satisfying it is to solve technical problems, I decided to switch my career to data engineering. Over the next few years, I would go on to teach myself data structures, algorithms, and programming through various courses and projects."

    description: The Jarvis Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent manages a linux cluster of servers running CentOS 7. Developed Bash scripts that gather data on hardware information and usage of hardware on all servers in the cluster and store it to a PostgresSQL database. The database is implemented as a Docker container. This allows the user to compare results and analyze the effective utilization of hardware resources.
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Developed a proof-of-concept project to help an online gift store analyze their sales data and find effective marketing strategies. For this project, we used Jupyter, a Python notebook, to perform our analyses. A PostgreSQL data warehouse was used to store client retail data. Using Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib, we manipulate the dataset and display the results. By using RFM market research, we were able to segment customers so that the store could develop marketing campaigns targeting both old and new customers."

      - "**Grep App:** Created the Java Grep Application which is an implementation of the Linux Grep command which search for a string of characters in a given directory and outputs them to another file. The application was created using Java Lambda/Stream API's with Apache Maven and deployed using Docker"
      - "**JDBC App:** Constructed the JDBC application using java JDBC API to perform CRUD operations using DAO and DTO design patterns on a PostgreSQL retail store's database."
